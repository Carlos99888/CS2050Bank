# CS2050Bank
Based on discussions in class, design an ADT for a financial instrument, name it ACCOUNT.
The overall goal is a manageable simulation of a bank or other financial system.
Think of all the different types of financial accounts, such as Savings, Checking, CD,
and anything else you can think of or invent. So what is the absolute minimum needed
to define ACCOUNT ADT, then implement as a Class. Each of the specific financial instruments
will be subclasses of ACCOUNT but for the time being, only define Savings and Checking.
Remember to create the Setters and Getters for each attribute and the appropriate constructors
